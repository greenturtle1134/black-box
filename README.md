# black-box
Typing behind a black screen.

This thing allows you to type without seeing what you're typing so that you aren't constantly editing what you've written. It's meant as a tool for people participating in [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org). After every word is written it slowly fades into the black void. A word count is provided to track your progress. It's kind of like [www.ilys.com](www.ilys.com) except it breaks by word, rather than character, and it doesn't charge money.

# How to use

You will need to click the black screen in order to start typing. Hold control and press enter to see what you've written. You can edit or copy it out. Press ctrl-enter again to go back to writing. Spaces and line breaks count as word changes, and your text will be saved to a file with the date and time every time you press enter.

# Things I plan on adding

+ **Options to change all the fonts, sizes, and colors**
+ Side panels with stats and stuff
+ Tracking of typing speed, possibly with a little animation or something to display it.
+ Mechanisms for NaNoWriMo style [Word Sprints](https://www.wikiwrimo.org/wiki/Word_war) or just a writing goal.

If you have any other ideas or found a bug, [complain on the Issues](../../issues) and I'll get to it.
